## üö® **High Priority Issues**

### 1. **Critical Bug Fix: Speed Boost Power-up** 
**Status:** Critical - Affects core gameplay  
**Issue:** Speed boost power-up currently speeds up ingredients instead of slowing them down  
**Location:** Power-up implementation in ingredient physics  
**Impact:** Confusing user experience, power-up doesn't match description  

### 2. **Architecture Modularization**
**Status:** High Priority - Technical debt  
**Issue:** Monolithic 2,700+ line file makes maintenance challenging  
**Impact:** Difficult debugging, testing, collaboration, and feature development  
**Goal:** Split into logical modules while maintaining single-file deployment  

### 3. **State Management System**
**Status:** High Priority - Code quality  
**Issue:** Heavy reliance on global variables reduces predictability  
**Impact:** Makes testing difficult, state changes unpredictable, debugging complex  
**Goal:** Implement centralized state management with clear data flow

## ‚ö° **Medium Priority Improvements**

### 4. **Object Pooling Implementation**
**Issue:** Frequent object creation/destruction causes GC pressure  
**Solution:** Pool particles, ingredients, and other frequently created objects  
**Benefit:** Smoother performance, reduced frame drops  

### 5. **Frame Rate Monitoring & Adaptive Quality**
**Issue:** No performance monitoring or quality adjustment  
**Solution:** Track frame times, implement adaptive quality levels  
**Benefit:** Better performance on lower-end devices  

### 6. **Enhanced Error Handling**
**Issue:** Limited error boundaries and exception handling  
**Solution:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks, graceful degradation  
**Benefit:** More robust user experience, easier debugging

## üîß **Low Priority Optimizations**

### 7. **Performance Profiling Tools**
**Goal:** Add frame time monitoring and bottleneck identification  

### 8. **WebGL Fallback**
**Goal:** Enhanced visual effects for supported browsers  

### 9. **Accessibility Features**
**Goal:** Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast options
