## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/burger-drop.git
cd burger-drop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development server
npm run dev
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run deploy
```

### Local Testing

A standalone build is included for quick local play. After cloning and
installing dependencies, open `index.html` in your browser. The page loads the
prebuilt bundle from `src/build/game.iife.js` so no server is required.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Cloudflare Workers Setup

1. **Install Wrangler CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This uploads `index.html` and the game bundle to Cloudflare and serves them via a lightweight Worker.

### GitHub Actions (Automatic Deployment)

The project includes automatic deployment via GitHub Actions. Add these secrets to your repository:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID

Pushes to the `main` branch will automatically deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Game logic (ingredients, orders, scoring)
- Collision detection
- Audio system functionality
- Power-up mechanics
- Cloudflare Worker deployment

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Single test run
npm run test:run

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
- **Base Points**: Each ingredient has a base point value
- **Combo Multiplier**: Consecutive correct ingredients increase multiplier
- **Time Bonus**: Faster order completion awards bonus points
- **Power-up Bonuses**: Special multipliers from power-ups

### Difficulty Scaling
- Ingredient fall speed increases over time
- More complex orders appear as game progresses
- Spawn rate increases with player skill level

## 🔧 Architecture

- **Static Deployment**: index.html served by Cloudflare Worker
- **Entity System**: Object-oriented design with Ingredient, Order, Particle, and PowerUp classes
- **Game Loop**: RequestAnimationFrame-based loop with delta time calculations
- **Performance Optimized**: Automatic particle culling and frame-rate aware animations
