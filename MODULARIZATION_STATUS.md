# Modularization Status

## ðŸš§ **Current State: In Progress**

We are in the middle of refactoring BurgerDrop from a monolithic structure to a modular architecture. The build system has been temporarily disabled to allow safe incremental development.

---

## âœ… **Completed Phases**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
- âœ… Created modular directory structure
- âœ… Added build system dependencies (Rollup, plugins)
- âœ… Created comprehensive improvement and modularization plans

### **Phase 2: Utility Modules**
- âœ… **Easing.js**: Extracted all animation easing functions
- âœ… **Colors.js**: Extracted color theme system and texture patterns  
- âœ… **Math.js**: Created comprehensive mathematical utilities
- âœ… **Added 10 new tests** covering all utility functions

### **Phase 3: State Management**
- âœ… **GameState.js**: Replaced 30+ global variables with centralized state
- âœ… **Event-driven architecture** with comprehensive validation
- âœ… **Added 38 new tests** with full GameState coverage

## ðŸ”„ **Current Status**

### **Build System**
- **Status**: Temporarily disabled during modularization
- **Current Build**: Uses original `worker.js` (monolithic)
- **Deployment**: Still works via existing GitHub Actions workflow
- **Tests**: 88 tests passing (up from original 40)

### **Why Build is Disabled**
The Rollup build system is configured but temporarily disabled because:
1. We haven't finished extracting all entity and system modules
2. The main `Game.js` entry point needs to be completed
3. HTML/CSS extraction needs to be finalized
4. We want to ensure each modularization step is tested before building

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

### **Phase 4: Entity Classes** (In Progress)
- [ ] Extract `Particle.js` class
- [ ] Extract `PowerUp.js` class  
- [ ] Extract `Ingredient.js` class
- [ ] Extract `Order.js` class

### **Phase 5: System Modules**
- [ ] Extract `Audio.js` system
- [ ] Extract `Renderer.js` system
- [ ] Extract `Input.js` system
- [ ] Extract `Physics.js` system

### **Phase 6: Build Integration**
- [ ] Complete main `Game.js` entry point
- [ ] Extract HTML/CSS into separate files
- [ ] Re-enable and test Rollup build
- [ ] Verify production build creates identical output
- [ ] Update deployment workflow

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Deployment Strategy**

### **Current Deployment** âœ…
- **Works**: Game deploys and runs normally at https://burger-drop.cory7593.workers.dev/
- **File**: Uses original monolithic `src/worker.js`
- **Tests**: All 88 tests pass, including new modular components

### **Future Deployment** (After Modularization)
- **Build**: Rollup will bundle modules back into single `worker.js`
- **Output**: Identical single-file deployment (no infrastructure changes)
- **Benefits**: Maintainable development, same deployment model

---

## ðŸš¨ **Important Notes**

1. **No Production Impact**: Current game continues to work normally
2. **Incremental Safety**: Each phase is tested before proceeding  
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Final build output will be identical to current structure
4. **Test Coverage**: Increased from 40 to 88 tests during modularization

---

## ðŸ”§ **For Developers**

### **Current Commands**
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server (works normally)
npm run test       # Run all 88 tests
npm run deploy     # Deploy current monolithic version
npm run build      # Temporarily disabled (shows status message)
```

### **Development Workflow**
1. Make changes to modular files in `src/game/`
2. Add tests for new modules
3. Keep `src/worker.js` as fallback until modularization complete
4. Once complete, re-enable build system and verify output

*This modularization is designed to improve maintainability while preserving all existing functionality and deployment simplicity.*
