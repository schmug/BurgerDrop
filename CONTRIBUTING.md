## Development Workflow

We follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. **All functional code must have corresponding tests without exception.**

### Before You Start

1. Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive development guidelines
2. Ensure you have Node.js 18.x or 20.x installed
3. Fork and clone the repository
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5. Run `npm run test:run` to verify your setup

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### The TDD Cycle

1. **Write Tests First** üî¥
   - Write tests that define expected behavior
   - Tests should fail initially (Red phase)
   - Cover both happy paths and edge cases

2. **Make Tests Pass** üü¢
   - Write minimal code to pass tests
   - Don't add functionality not covered by tests
   - Focus on making tests green

3. **Refactor** üîµ
   - Improve code quality
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Optimize performance if needed

### Example TDD Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-ingredient-type

# 2. Write your test first
# Edit: tests/entities.test.js

# 3. Run tests to see them fail
npm run test:watch

# 4. Implement the feature
# Edit: src/game/entities/Ingredient.js

# 5. Run tests until they pass
# Tests will auto-run in watch mode

# 6. Check coverage
npm run test:coverage

# 7. Run full checks before committing
npm run check:full
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% line coverage required
- **Test Types**: Write both unit and integration tests
- **No Mocks in Production**: Never commit dummy or mockup code
- **Test Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `docs/update-description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines:
- Use present tense, imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- First line: 50 characters or less
- Reference issues: "Fix #123: Resolve score calculation bug"
- Be descriptive and specific

### Example Commit Messages

```

- Add power-up collision tests
- Fix ingredient spawn rate scaling
- Refactor audio system for better performance
- Update README with new setup instructions

‚ùå Bad:

```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Run Pre-commit Checks**
   ```bash
   npm run precommit
   ```

2. **Ensure All Tests Pass**
   ```bash
   npm run test:run
   ```

3. **Verify Coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

4. **Build Successfully**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
